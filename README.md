This is a Capstone project for Microsoft #NG30daysoflearning 

___
# Project objective : Problem stament
* The goal of our project is to analyze the dataset, develop a visualization aspect which shows the trends of Airplane Crashes and number of Fatalities. We have considered answering some of the questions below:
* What is the Total number of Airplane Crashes from 1908 to 2009?
* what is the Total number of Fatalities from 1908 to 2009?
* What is the Total number of Passengers involved in the Crashes from 1908 to 2009?
 * What is the Fatality rate?
* How many planes crashed per Year? how many people were on board? how many survived? how many died?
* What is the highest number of crashes by operator and Type of aircrafts?

# Data sourcing
At the time of this project The Dataset was created in Kaggle (2016-09-09), the original version was hosted by Open Data by Socrata at the  [at[{https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq,} but unfortunately that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.
___

# Data Transformation 
*Changing each column to  an appropriate Data type 
* Expanding necessary column's width to prevent text overflow
* Using the Date column to create new Year, Month and Day columns
___
# Data Modelling 


* We Calculated a new Dax measure to ascertain the Total number of Crashes, by Counting the Total number of rows using the following formula : Total crashes = Count((Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[).
* We Calculated a new Dax measure to ascertain the Total number of Fatalities,  by summing the Fatalities column using the formula: Total fatalities = sum(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Fatalities])
* We Calculated a new Dax measure to ascertain the Total number of Passengers,  by summing the Passengers column using the formula: Total passengers = sum(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_since_1908[Passengers])
* We Calculated the Fatality rate using the formula: Fatality rate = Divide([Total Fatalities],[Total passengers]Ã—100

Douglas DC-3 has the highest number of  crashes with a Total of 334 crashes.
___
#Conclusion.
*The 1972 has the highest number of Fatalities and highest number of crashes.
*Douglas Airplanes have the highest number of crashes as the planes took first,third,fourth and fifth places in number of Crashes 
*Year with high crashes might not have the highest Fatalities
